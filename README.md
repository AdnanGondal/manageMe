## About

Manage-me is a project management app. It gives the user the ability to add projects. For each project, the user can add tasks that have a title, a description, a priority level and a due date. The user can also remove any projects or tasks they do not wish to keep. The user can modify the names of projects and tasks by double clicking them. 

This project makes use of the JavaScript ES6 Modules (Webpack). An attempt to follow the SOLID OOP principles has been made. 


## Usage

The site has been deployed to Github Pages and can be accessed via:

## Roadmap
There are plans to include the Firebase backend, so that users can access their projects on multiple devices via Google Authentication. 

## Project status

Development on this project has been put on pause.
